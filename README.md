# PubMed Research Tools

This project provides a set of tools for conducting research using PubMed data, leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to generate insights from scientific literature.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development. Features and functionalities may change, and the documentation is still being updated.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `RAGEvaluation/`: Contains notebooks and scripts for evaluating the RAG pipeline.
- `data/`: Stores data used for the project, such as datasets and scraped articles.
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the project.
- `data_processing.py`: Scripts for processing and cleaning data.
- `embeddings.py`: Code related to generating and handling text embeddings.
- `evaluation.py`: Scripts for evaluating the performance of the RAG models.
- `iterations.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for iterative development and testing.
- `langgraph.json`: Configuration for LangGraph, if used.
- `prompts.py`: Stores and manages prompts for the language models.
- `pubmed_scraper.py`: Scripts for scraping data from PubMed.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and dependencies.
- `rag_chain.py`: Core logic for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain.
- `retrieval.py`: Functions and classes for document retrieval.
- `retrieval_formatter.py`: Scripts for formatting data for retrieval.
- `source_formatter.py`: Scripts for formatting source documents.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project.

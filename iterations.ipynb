       "Article: Quality of life, primary traumatisation, and positive and negative affects in primary school students in the Gaza Strip.Many researchers have reported that exposure to war and ongoing political violence increases mental health problems in children. Results of studies have also shown a high prevalence (58-80%) of post-traumatic stress disorder in war-affected children living in the occupied Palestinian territory. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and indirect effects of perceived life satisfaction on the consequences of children's exposure to trauma and the balance of positive and negative affect. Palestinian children were recruited from primary schools in four refugee camps in the Gaza Strip (Bureij, Gaza Beach Camp, Jabalia, Rafah). All children had been involved in or witnessed one or more episodes of violence involving other people in the 2 months prior to the study (the 2012 Gaza War). We used the Multidimensional Students Life Satisfaction Scale (peers, self, living environment, school, family), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, and the revised Children Impact of Events scale (intrusion and avoidance symptoms) to test (through structural equation modelling) the moderation effect of life satisfaction on war trauma via positive emotions. 1276 Palestinian children were enrolled in this study.\n",

       "Interviewees revealed that their perceptions of their children's health were determined by the camp's conditions, the current economic climate, past and current political conflict and financial and social restrictions. The understanding of being healthy incorporated physical and mental health as well as social well-being. As a result, 70% of interviewees deemed that their children were not in good health. This finding accelerated to 100% after the Gaza War, showing the negative effect war has on health perceptions. Findings showed that perceptions of physical health are very much interlinked with mental well-being and parents' perceptions of their children's health, and are closely related to their state of mental health. Consequently, a clear correlation can be discerned between the ongoing occupation and its detrimental effects on mental health. Therapeutic and preventive health programmes such as child therapy and stress management that have already been implemented by the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme would be highly beneficial to both children and adults in Dheisheh refugee camp.\n",

The questions related to physical, mental and social well-being, access to health facilities, factors that were likely to hinder health and measures that could be implemented to improve child health. The study was carried out prior to and during the Gaza War in December 2008 that resulted in the deaths of 1380 Palestinians including 431 children and 112 women [1].

Current war trauma, as reported separately by mothers, fathers and their children, refers to the Gaza War 2008/09. Children reported their symptoms of PTSD, depression, and psychological distress. Results revealed seven communication content categories and one category indicating maintaining silence about the traumas. Fathers' high exposure to current war trauma was associated with a higher level of communicating facts, reasons, and meanings regarding the1948 and 1967 wars, and mothers' high exposure to current war trauma was associated with a lower level of maintaining silence. Family communication about facts, reasons, and meanings was significantly associated with children not showing PTSD and marginally with not showing psychological distress, while maintaining silence was not associated with children's mental health.\n",

The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war.

Yet, little is known regarding the influence of trauma on infant development and the potential explanatory mechanisms. First, the present study examines how mothers' prenatal exposure to traumatic war events is associated with infant cognitive, motor, and socioemotional development. Second, it analyses the mediating roles of maternal postpartum mental health problems, quality of dyadic mother-infant interaction, and earlier infant development (at six months) in the association between prenatal traumatic war events and infants' developmental skills at 18 months. This prospective three-wave study involved 502 Palestinian pregnant females in their first trimester during the 2014 Gaza War and participated at delivery (T1) and when the child was six (T2;N = 392) and eighteen (T3; N = 386) months of age. Mothers reported their exposure to traumatic war events (human and material losses, horrors, and threat to life) at T1 and T2, and researchers photo-documented the extent of destruction at T1.\n",

       "The study, *Needs Assessment Study of Children with Disabilities, Injured and Separated or Unaccompanied*, was conducted by the Community Training Centre for Crisis Management (CTCCM) with support from the War Child Alliance. It paints a harrowing picture of children’s mental health under Israeli bombardment and blockade.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We met with injured, separated, and disabled children and their caregivers to hear from them about the toll of war on their lives. What they shared was devastating – but sadly, not surprising. This study reinforces what we have seen, heard and witnessed over more than a year. Children are traumatised by this war, and we must respond,” says a spokesperson and Project Technical Coordinator from CTCCM in Gaza.\n",
       "\n",
       "The findings in this study are stark. Caregivers report that 96% of children feel death is imminent, and nearly half believe they will die because of the war. Many children exhibit symptoms of aggression, fear, withdrawal, and severe anxiety, alongside a pervasive sense of hopelessness. Years of displacement, loss, and relentless bombing have left children psychologically scarred and their families in dire circumstances.\n",
       "\n",
       "The survey of 504 households reveals that 88% of families have been displaced multiple times, with 21% forced to move six or more times. Most families live on less than €122 a month, grappling with soaring prices for food and essentials due to the ongoing blockade and restrictions on humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, 80% of breadwinners are unemployed, reflecting the devastating economic consequences of the war.\n",
       "\n",
       "“For children in Gaza, nowhere is safe. They have seen homes destroyed, loved ones killed, and schools turned to rubble. Even so-called evacuation zones are not spared from bombing. The mental health of Gaza’s children is under constant attack,” says Rob Williams, War Child Alliance CEO.\n",
       "\n",
       "The findings of the report\\* emphasise that the international community must act urgently. A ceasefire is imperative to allow the unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid. Critical supplies, including medical provisions and nutritional supplements, must reach those in need immediately. Mental health and psychosocial support must be scaled up to address the widespread trauma experienced by children and their families.\n",
       "\n",
       "Amidst this devastation, War Child and its partners have stepped in to provide life-saving assistance. Since the war began, their efforts have reached over 180,000 people, including 118,000 children. This includes emergency provisions such as food, clean water, hygiene kits, warm clothing, and blankets.\n",
       "\n",
       "Recognising the acute mental health crisis, War Child, CTCCM and other partners have begun addressing the trauma experienced by more than 17,000 children. Programmes such as psychological first aid, adapted versions of TeamUp, and recreational activities in child-friendly spaces are providing moments of relief amidst the chaos. These interventions are vital, helping children process their emotions and find resilience in the face of unimaginable stress. War Child is also addressing the needs of unaccompanied and separated children, a particularly vulnerable group. So far, over 580 of these children have been directly supported, with efforts underway to connect them with essential services and caregivers.\n",

       "**Aim**: To illustrate the psychological burden on Gaza’s children and highlight their complex mental health needs amid the conflict.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Methods**: We report cases of 4 children receiving support from Children Not Numbers, who have lived through the violence in Gaza, illustrating the devastating impact of the conflict on their mental health.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Results**: The children exhibited symptoms of trauma, including emotional dysregulation, social withdrawal, grief, and worsening of pre-existing conditions. Common factors were displacement, loss of family members, physical injuries, and lack of mental health care resources.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Conclusion**: The cases highlight the severe psychological impact of the conflict on children and the urgent need for interventions to address the crisis and provide mental health services to prevent long-term consequences for the wellbeing of children in Gaza.\n",

In order to understand the underlying mechanisms operating between trauma and mental health problems, in a subsequent study we compared children whose houses had been demolished with children matched for age and gender from areas indirectly exposed to other types of traumatic events, mainly through the media and adults (Thabet _et al_, 2002).\n",

       "The emotional distress of dodging bombs and bullets, losing loved ones, being forced to flee through streets littered with debris and corpses, and waking up every morning not knowing if they will be able to eat has also left parents and caregivers increasingly unable to cope. The support, services and tools they need to care for their children are further and further out of reach.\n",

They already lacked resilience and now it’s very difficult to cope. The children are scared, angry and can’t stop crying. Even many adults do the same. This is too much for adults to cope with, let alone children.*”\n",

       "Amal\\*, a mother of four children in Gaza aged between 7 and 14, said: “*Some of my children can’t concentrate on basic tasks anymore. They forget things that I’ve told them immediately and can’t remember things that have just happened. I wouldn’t even say that their mental health has deteriorated – it’s been obliterated. Complete psychological destruction.”*\n",

       "The findings come as the Ministry of Health in Gaza reports that more than 30,717 people, including 12,550 children, have been killed since Israel’s military escalation in Gaza that started on 7 October\\* in retaliation to attacks on Israel killing 1200 people, including 33 children and taking more than 240 hostages, according to the Government of Israel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lack of food and clean water is also creating a catastrophic hunger crisis, with nearly every child in Gaza at risk of famine. At least 15 children have died of malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health\\*. With barely any health facilities functioning and families cut off from medical services, it is likely that the real figure is far higher – and all this is causing anxiety and stress in children and families to skyrocket, Save the Children said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even before 7 October, children in Gaza were living with exceptionally poor mental health due to cyclical escalations of violence, the impacts of the blockade including restrictions on freedom of movement and access to essential services, economic collapse, and separation from family and friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "Those surveyed for the new report said they had witnessed a dramatic deterioration in the mental health of children that is much worse than during previous escalations in violence, manifesting in fear, anxiety, disordered eating, bedwetting, hyper-vigilance and sleep problems as well as behavioural changes such as an alternation in attachment style with parents, regression and aggression.\n",

       "Ten-year-old Waed remembers vividly the terrifying day she and her family were forced to flee Khan Younis under fire, running past tanks to find shelter in a school. “That memory is stuck in my head,” she says.\n",
       "\n",
       "Waed speaks softly as she describes a technique she learned at a UNICEF-supported mental health and psychosocial support activity. It's called the “TV method” — she visualizes a difficult memory and then imagines breaking it like a screen.\n",

       "For almost two years, children in Gaza have opened their eyes every morning to another day of displacement, loss and lack of access to basic services. The threat of violence is always there, the trauma compounding.\n",
       "\n",
       "In humanitarian tents, children gather to share their fears and sorrows, and to comfort one another. UNICEF-trained counselors share strategies that help kids cope with anxiety, grief and despair. Recreational kits provided by UNICEF contain supplies for stress-relieving games and activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thirteen-year-old Raja learned to visualize a safe space by closing her eyes and imagining herself in her home, now destroyed. Sometimes she pictures herself enjoying a warm meal of rice and meat — something she hasn’t had in over four months due to the [**severe food shortages**](/stories/children-gaza-critical-risk-famine) in Gaza. “It’s a meal we used to eat together as a family,” she said quietly. “Now, I can only imagine it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Raja admits the exercise wasn’t easy at first. Revisiting a place she never thought she’d lose is painful. “That home doesn’t exist anymore,” she says, her voice heavy with grief. “And that breaks my heart.”\n",

       "\n",
       "The ongoing crisis has severely impacted mental health in Gaza of its population, particularly affecting children and young people who make up 65% of residents. Even before recent events, studies indicated that over half of Gaza’s children experienced PTSD. The current situation, marked by displacement and loss, has intensified psychological trauma among the population of 2.1 million, of whom two-thirds are refugees.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implications of mental health including anxiety, depression, and PTSD often go untreated due to multiple barriers: limited mental health resources, insufficient training among healthcare providers, and restrictions on humanitarian aid. This lack of treatment can have far-reaching consequences, affecting children’s educational outcomes, social development, and future employment prospects. The psychological effect of war and sense of hopelessness can make young people particularly vulnerable to negative influences, contributing to ongoing cycles of social instability.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Psychological Trauma Experienced by Children in Gaza**\n",
       "\n",
       "The psychological effect of war encompasses a complex web of traumatic experiences. Children in Gaza are exposed to continuous bombing and violence, witnessing the loss of parents and family members. The complete disruption of basic life necessities—including water, education, and safety—compounds their psychological suffering. The widespread destruction of homes, schools, and healthcare facilities has stripped away every sense of security and normalcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Impact of War on Children’s Mental Health**\n",
       "\n",
       "A recent needs assessment study conducted by the Community Training Centre for Crisis Management, supported by the War Child Alliance, reveals the impact of war on children. The research, which examined children with disabilities and those who are injured or unaccompanied, found an alarming 96% of children live in constant fear for their lives, with nearly half believing they will not survive the conflict. Children commonly display behavioral changes including aggression, withdrawal, and severe anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "The study of 504 households also highlights the widespread displacement of families, with 88% having been forced to relocate multiple times – over a fifth moving six times or more. The economic toll is equally severe, with 80% of primary income earners now unemployed. Most families survive on less than €122 monthly while facing inflated prices for basic necessities due to restricted access to humanitarian supplies.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **The Importance of Psychosocial Support and Interventions**\n",
       "\n",
       "Comprehensive psychosocial support is crucial for preventing long-term mental destruction. It represents more than treatment—it’s a lifeline that helps children rebuild their emotional worlds, restore hope, and recreate a sense of future possibility. By addressing trauma holistically, these interventions aim to support the community’s collective healing. \n",
       "\n",
       "The PAMA-sponsored project with Juzoor (Welfare Association) demonstrates its importance through standardized shelter activities that prioritize psychosocial first aid, specifically identifying children at risk, and providing intervention therapy within the shelters. This comprehensive approach resulted in serving 3,071 individuals with mental health and psychosocial support in one month alone, with children making up approximately 60% of beneficiaries. Structured interventions help children cope with the ongoing crisis through group activities, demonstrating the importance of regular, sustained psychological care.\n",
       "\n",
       "What makes this support particularly crucial is its integration into the broader healthcare system. The report from the implementation team in Gaza shows that psychosocial support is delivered alongside other vital health services through mobile health teams that include doctors, nurses, psychologists, and midwives. This integrated approach ensures that mental health in Gaza support isn’t treated as an afterthought but as a fundamental component of comprehensive healthcare delivery.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Gaza Community Mental Health Programs**\n",
       "\n",
       "PAMA and partner organizations are committed to supporting mental health for Gaza’s children through targeted initiatives. These include child trauma counseling, school-based mental health support, community resilience workshops, and trauma-informed care training for local healthcare providers. \n",
       "\n",

         "In conflict settings, public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns and improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could benefit all parties involved. However, while polio vaccination campaigns frequently succeed in securing humanitarian pauses, WASH initiatives attempting to improve safe water supply and sewage disposal rarely achieve the same outcome. Using the Israel-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the success of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify four key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in conflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the subsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, including the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the shortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the straightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their \"neutral\" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the primary beneficiaries. Although polio vaccination campaigns do not typically lead to lasting peace and WASH initiatives often fail to secure even temporary humanitarian pauses, public health efforts should seize every opportunity to foster cooperation between warring parties. Such initiatives can help build trust, laying the groundwork for future peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction.",

         "To categorize and analyze trauma cases from the Gaza war, identifying injury patterns and informing future humanitarian efforts in conflict zones. A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2024 at European Gaza Hospital. Data on demographics and injury types were collected from patients treated by FAJR Scientific's surgical team. Injuries were classified into primary (directly conflict-related), secondary (indirectly conflict-related), and tertiary (unrelated to the conflict). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H test, logistic regression, and Fisher's Exact Test. Among the 80 surgical cases analyzed, primary injuries were the most common (53%), predominantly affecting males aged 30-39. Secondary injuries accounted for 14% of cases, while tertiary injuries represented 33%. Significant associations were found between age categories and injury classifications (p < 0.05). The prevalence of primary injuries highlights the severe impact of conflict on civilians, particularly middle-aged males. The findings suggest the need for enhanced orthopedic surgical capacity, integrated chronic disease management, and specialized pediatric care in conflict zones. Improved data collection and analysis are essential for optimizing medical interventions and resource allocation.",

         "Adolescents are increasingly consuming energy drinks (EDs), prompting worries about their potential mental health impacts. The association between ED use and psychological effects among Palestinian teenagers, particularly the impact of smoking habits such as waterpipes, electronic cigarettes, and cigarettes, is little studied. This study explores the correlation between ED consumption and mental health outcomes such as depression, insomnia, and stress among adolescents in Palestine. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June 2024, involving adolescents aged 12-18 recruited from schools in the West Bank. Data collection utilized a structured questionnaire assessing ED consumption, smoking habits, depression (PHQ-9), insomnia (ISI), and stress (Adolescent Stress Scale). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29. The research involved 1,668 adolescents, with a mean age of 15.67 years (±1.57 years). ED consumption was prevalent at 74.7 % (95 % CI: 76.5-72.7). Males and smokers, especially those using traditional cigarettes and waterpipes, exhibited a higher likelihood of consuming energy drinks (aPR: 2.18; 95 %CI: 1.64-2.91), (aPR: 2.99; 95 %CI: 1.49-5.59), and (aPR: 2.54; 95 %CI: 1.23-5.19). Depression exhibited a significant relationship with ED consumption (aPR: 2.25; 95%CI: 1.51-3.37). A dose-response relationship was identified between insomnia and ED consumption, with an adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) of 2.42 (95 % CI: 1.56-3.47) for moderate severity and 2.95 (95 % CI: 1.28-6.75) for severe insomnia. ED consumption is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly among smokers. Interventions targeting both ED use and smoking behaviors are crucial to improving mental health in Palestinian adolescents. The study was conducted during the Gaza war, a period marked by heightened stress levels among participants due to increased security checks and economic hardships. These challenges may have influenced participants' stress levels and impacted their purchasing behaviors for EDs and tobacco shisha products. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of these behaviors.",

         "Secondary traumatic stress (STS) has been studied in therapists, spouses, and mainly in children of traumatised individuals. To date, the relationship between children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their parents' mental health outcomes have been understudied, and specifically, long term STS symptoms of parents of war veterans were not investigated. The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war. The control group consisted of veterans from combat military units who were on active duty at the time of the war but did not actively participate in the war (stand-by units) - providing a natural experiment condition. We found that PTSD symptoms were almost twice as high in the directly active war veterans (DAV, <i>N</i> = 32) group compared to the indirectly active war veterans (IAV, <i>N</i> = 26) group. Results showed that mothers had higher STS symptoms in general, and DAV PTSD symptoms correlated with their fathers STS symptoms. The current study provides novel evidence for: (a) subclinical PTSD symptoms in war veterans 5 years after the war, and (b) transmission of trauma from war veterans to their parents. The overall negative effect of sending a child to war on the parents are also discussed.",

         "Polio vaccination campaigns in conflicts: succeeding while other humanitarian efforts fail?In conflict settings, public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns and improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could benefit all parties involved. However, while polio vaccination campaigns frequently succeed in securing humanitarian pauses, WASH initiatives attempting to improve safe water supply and sewage disposal rarely achieve the same outcome. Using the Israel-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the success of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify four key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in conflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the subsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, including the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the shortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the straightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their \"neutral\" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the primary beneficiaries. Although polio vaccination campaigns do not typically lead to lasting peace and WASH initiatives often fail to secure even temporary humanitarian pauses, public health efforts should seize every opportunity to foster cooperation between warring parties. Such initiatives can help build trust, laying the groundwork for future peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction."

         "Trauma by the Numbers: A Cross-Sectional Analysis and Categorization of Trauma Cases in the Gaza War.To categorize and analyze trauma cases from the Gaza war, identifying injury patterns and informing future humanitarian efforts in conflict zones. A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2024 at European Gaza Hospital. Data on demographics and injury types were collected from patients treated by FAJR Scientific's surgical team. Injuries were classified into primary (directly conflict-related), secondary (indirectly conflict-related), and tertiary (unrelated to the conflict). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H test, logistic regression, and Fisher's Exact Test. Among the 80 surgical cases analyzed, primary injuries were the most common (53%), predominantly affecting males aged 30-39. Secondary injuries accounted for 14% of cases, while tertiary injuries represented 33%. Significant associations were found between age categories and injury classifications (p < 0.05). The prevalence of primary injuries highlights the severe impact of conflict on civilians, particularly middle-aged males. The findings suggest the need for enhanced orthopedic surgical capacity, integrated chronic disease management, and specialized pediatric care in conflict zones. Improved data collection and analysis are essential for optimizing medical interventions and resource allocation."

         "Energy drinks, depression, insomnia, and stress in palestinian adolescents: a cross-sectional study.Adolescents are increasingly consuming energy drinks (EDs), prompting worries about their potential mental health impacts. The association between ED use and psychological effects among Palestinian teenagers, particularly the impact of smoking habits such as waterpipes, electronic cigarettes, and cigarettes, is little studied. This study explores the correlation between ED consumption and mental health outcomes such as depression, insomnia, and stress among adolescents in Palestine. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June 2024, involving adolescents aged 12-18 recruited from schools in the West Bank. Data collection utilized a structured questionnaire assessing ED consumption, smoking habits, depression (PHQ-9), insomnia (ISI), and stress (Adolescent Stress Scale). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29. The research involved 1,668 adolescents, with a mean age of 15.67 years (±1.57 years). ED consumption was prevalent at 74.7 % (95 % CI: 76.5-72.7). Males and smokers, especially those using traditional cigarettes and waterpipes, exhibited a higher likelihood of consuming energy drinks (aPR: 2.18; 95 %CI: 1.64-2.91), (aPR: 2.99; 95 %CI: 1.49-5.59), and (aPR: 2.54; 95 %CI: 1.23-5.19). Depression exhibited a significant relationship with ED consumption (aPR: 2.25; 95%CI: 1.51-3.37). A dose-response relationship was identified between insomnia and ED consumption, with an adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) of 2.42 (95 % CI: 1.56-3.47) for moderate severity and 2.95 (95 % CI: 1.28-6.75) for severe insomnia. ED consumption is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly among smokers. Interventions targeting both ED use and smoking behaviors are crucial to improving mental health in Palestinian adolescents. The study was conducted during the Gaza war, a period marked by heightened stress levels among participants due to increased security checks and economic hardships. These challenges may have influenced participants' stress levels and impacted their purchasing behaviors for EDs and tobacco shisha products. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of these behaviors."

         "Post-traumatic stress in war veterans and secondary traumatic stress among parents of war veterans five years after the 2014 Israel-Gaza military conflict.Secondary traumatic stress (STS) has been studied in therapists, spouses, and mainly in children of traumatised individuals. To date, the relationship between children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their parents' mental health outcomes have been understudied, and specifically, long term STS symptoms of parents of war veterans were not investigated. The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war. The control group consisted of veterans from combat military units who were on active duty at the time of the war but did not actively participate in the war (stand-by units) - providing a natural experiment condition. We found that PTSD symptoms were almost twice as high in the directly active war veterans (DAV, <i>N</i> = 32) group compared to the indirectly active war veterans (IAV, <i>N</i> = 26) group. Results showed that mothers had higher STS symptoms in general, and DAV PTSD symptoms correlated with their fathers STS symptoms. The current study provides novel evidence for: (a) subclinical PTSD symptoms in war veterans 5 years after the war, and (b) transmission of trauma from war veterans to their parents. The overall negative effect of sending a child to war on the parents are also discussed."

         "[\"Article: Family systems approach to attachment relations, war trauma, and mental health among Palestinian children and parents.<b>Background</b>: Trauma affects the family unit as a whole; however, most existing research uses individual or, at most, dyadic approaches to analyse families with histories of trauma. <b>Objective</b>: This study aims to identify potentially distinct family types according to attachment, parenting, and sibling relations, to analyse how these family types differ with respect to war trauma, and to explore how children's mental health and cognitive processing differ across these family types. <b>Method:</b> Participants included Palestinian mothers and fathers (<i>N</i>\\xa0=\\xa0325) and their children (one per family; 49.4% girls; 10-13\\xa0years old; mean\\xa0±\\xa0<i>SD</i> age\\xa0=\\xa011.35 ± 0.57 years) after the Gaza War of 2008-2009. Both parents reported their exposure to war trauma, secure attachment availability, and parenting practices, as well as the target child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. Children reported their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (on the Children's Revised Impact Event Scale), depression (Birleson), and SDQ, as well as their post-traumatic cognitions (Children's Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory). <b>Results:</b> A cluster analysis identified four family types. The largest type reflected secure attachment and optimal relationships (security and positive family relationships, 36.2%, <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa0102), and the smallest exhibited insecurity and problematic relationships (insecurity and negative family relationships, 15.6%; <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa044). Further, families with discrepant experiences (23.0%; <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa065) and moderate security and neutral relationships (25.2%; <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa071) emerged.\\n\\nArticle: Quality of life, primary traumatisation, and positive and negative affects in primary school students in the Gaza Strip.Many researchers have reported that exposure to war and ongoing political violence increases mental health problems in children. Results of studies have also shown a high prevalence (58-80%) of post-traumatic stress disorder in war-affected children living in the occupied Palestinian territory. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and indirect effects of perceived life satisfaction on the consequences of children's exposure to trauma and the balance of positive and negative affect. Palestinian children were recruited from primary schools in four refugee camps in the Gaza Strip (Bureij, Gaza Beach Camp, Jabalia, Rafah). All children had been involved in or witnessed one or more episodes of violence involving other people in the 2 months prior to the study (the 2012 Gaza War). We used the Multidimensional Students Life Satisfaction Scale (peers, self, living environment, school, family), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, and the revised Children Impact of Events scale (intrusion and avoidance symptoms) to test (through structural equation modelling) the moderation effect of life satisfaction on war trauma via positive emotions. 1276 Palestinian children were enrolled in this study.\\n\\nArticle: Is silence about trauma harmful for children? Transgenerational communication in Palestinian families.Style of family communication is considered important in the transgenerational transmission of trauma. This study had three aims: first, to identify the contents of family communication about past national trauma; second, to examine how parents' current war trauma is associated with transgenerational communication; and third, to analyze the associations between transgenerational communication and children's mental health, measured as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and psychological distress. The study sample consisted of 170 Palestinian families in Gaza Strip, in which both mothers (n\\u2009=\\u2009170) and fathers (n\\u2009=\\u2009170) participated, each with their 11-13-year-old child.\\n\\nInterviewees revealed that their perceptions of their children's health were determined by the camp's conditions, the current economic climate, past and current political conflict and financial and social restrictions. The understanding of being healthy incorporated physical and mental health as well as social well-being. As a result, 70% of interviewees deemed that their children were not in good health. This finding accelerated to 100% after the Gaza War, showing the negative effect war has on health perceptions. Findings showed that perceptions of physical health are very much interlinked with mental well-being and parents' perceptions of their children's health, and are closely related to their state of mental health. Consequently, a clear correlation can be discerned between the ongoing occupation and its detrimental effects on mental health. Therapeutic and preventive health programmes such as child therapy and stress management that have already been implemented by the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme would be highly beneficial to both children and adults in Dheisheh refugee camp.\\n\\nArticle: The impact of occupation on child health in a Palestinian refugee camp.This article focuses on child health in the Palestinian refugee camp of Dheisheh in the West Bank region of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Thirty in-depth interviews were carried out with parents to determine their perceptions of their children's health. The questions related to physical, mental and social well-being, access to health facilities, factors that were likely to hinder health and measures that could be implemented to improve child health. The study was carried out prior to and during the Gaza War in December 2008 that resulted in the deaths of 1380 Palestinians including 431 children and 112 women [1]. The effects of occupation, conflict and being a refugee had a detrimental impact on perceptions of health.\"]",
         "A family systems approach, as identified in research on Palestinian children after the Gaza War, shows that maternal mental health is a central component of the family unit's overall functioning. War trauma affects the entire family system, and maternal mental health is closely linked to children's mental health and well-being. Consequently, the mother's psychological state can significantly influence infant developmental skills within the conflict-stricken family environment.",
         "A family systems approach identified distinct family types among Palestinian families after the Gaza War, with the most secure type characterized by secure attachment and optimal relationships. This approach analyzes the family unit as a whole. Separately, research on infant development in war conditions shows that high maternal exposure to traumatic war events can negatively impact infant motor, cognitive-language, and socioemotional skills through the underlying mechanism of increased maternal mental health problems. Improving maternal mental health is considered critical for infant development in these conflict settings.",

         "Based on the provided context, prenatal exposure to war trauma is linked to infant developmental outcomes via its impact on maternal postpartum mental health and mother-infant interactions. For parents of war veterans, secondary traumatic stress (STS) can develop from their children's PTSD symptoms, a relationship that was observed five years after the 2014 Gaza War.

         "Prenatal exposure to traumatic war events, such as human and material losses, horrors, and threat to life during the 2014 Gaza War, can negatively impact maternal mental health. This is significant because research on the 2014 Israel-Gaza military conflict found that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in directly active war veterans were correlated with secondary traumatic stress (STS) symptoms in their parents, particularly their fathers. This provides evidence for the transmission of trauma from war veterans to their parents, with maternal mental health being a potential explanatory mechanism for the broader negative effects of war trauma on families.",

Mothers reported their exposure to traumatic war events (human and material losses, horrors, and threat to life) at T1 and T2, and researchers photo-documented the extent of destruction at T1.\\n\\nArticle: How Does Parenthood Moderate Paths Between Personal and Community Resources and Distress following Collective Trauma?This study examines the moderating role of parenthood in associations between personal and community resources and psychological distress and somatization following collective exposure to security threats. The research questions were guided by Terror Management Theory that posits that parenthood involves heightened anxiety when children are in danger yet may also provide an existential resource that can reduce the individuals' distress. The study was conducted following the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict and included 1014 Israelis. The participants completed a questionnaire assessing levels of trauma exposure (the predictors), sense of mastery (personal resource), engagement in community activities and trust in leaders (community resources), and psychological distress and somatization (the outcomes). Results indicated that parenthood moderated several associations between trauma exposure and personal and community resources as well as paths between these resources and psychological distress. In almost all these cases, these paths were statistically significant only among parents in two different directions. Parenthood was associated with more psychological distress through lower sense of mastery and greater engagement in community activities. On the other hand, parenthood was related to lower psychological distress through greater trust in local leaders. In addition, only among parents, lower levels of mastery mediated the association between trauma exposure and somatization.\\n\\nArticle: Post-traumatic stress in war veterans and secondary traumatic stress among parents of war veterans five years after the 2014 Israel-Gaza military conflict.Secondary traumatic stress (STS) has been studied in therapists, spouses, and mainly in children of traumatised individuals. To date, the relationship between children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their parents' mental health outcomes have been understudied, and specifically, long term STS symptoms of parents of war veterans were not investigated. The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war. The control group consisted of veterans from combat military units who were on active duty at the time of the war but did not actively participate in the war (stand-by units) - providing a natural experiment condition.\\n\\nArticle: Quality of life, primary traumatisation, and positive and negative affects in primary school students in the Gaza Strip.Many researchers have reported that exposure to war and ongoing political violence increases mental health problems in children. Results of studies have also shown a high prevalence (58-80%) of post-traumatic stress disorder in war-affected children living in the occupied Palestinian territory. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and indirect effects of perceived life satisfaction on the consequences of children's exposure to trauma and the balance of positive and negative affect. Palestinian children were recruited from primary schools in four refugee camps in the Gaza Strip (Bureij, Gaza Beach Camp, Jabalia, Rafah). All children had been involved in or witnessed one or more episodes of violence involving other people in the 2 months prior to the study (the 2012 Gaza War). We used the Multidimensional Students Life Satisfaction Scale (peers, self, living environment, school, family), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children, and the revised Children Impact of Events scale (intrusion and avoidance symptoms) to test (through structural equation modelling) the moderation effect of life satisfaction on war trauma via positive emotions. 1276 Palestinian children were enrolled in this study.\\n\\nMothers and fathers responded separately to three questions: 1) what did their own parents tell them about the War of 1948, Nakba?; 2) what did they tell their own children about the Nakba?; and 3) What did they tell their own children about the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and military occupation? Current war trauma, as reported separately by mothers, fathers and their children, refers to the Gaza War 2008/09. Children reported their symptoms of PTSD, depression, and psychological distress. Results revealed seven communication content categories and one category indicating maintaining silence about the traumas. Fathers' high exposure to current war trauma was associated with a higher level of communicating facts, reasons, and meanings regarding the1948 and 1967 wars, and mothers' high exposure to current war trauma was associated with a lower level of maintaining silence. Family communication about facts, reasons, and meanings was significantly associated with children not showing PTSD and marginally with not showing psychological distress, while maintaining silence was not associated with children's mental health.\"]",
         "War trauma from the 2014 Gaza War negatively affects maternal mental health, which in turn can impair infant cognitive, motor, and socioemotional development. For parents, the collective trauma can increase psychological distress, particularly by reducing their sense of mastery. However, parenthood can also moderate this distress, sometimes increasing it through community engagement or decreasing it through greater trust in leaders.",
         "Mothers' prenatal exposure to traumatic war events during the 2014 Gaza War was associated with negative impacts on infant cognitive, motor, and socioemotional development, mediated by maternal postpartum mental health problems. Following the war, 100% of parents in a refugee camp perceived their children as not being in good health, showing the negative effect of war on health perceptions, which are interlinked with mental well-being. Furthermore, collective trauma exposure during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict affected parents differently, with parenthood moderating the association between trauma exposure and psychological distress, where a lower sense of mastery increased distress and somatization among parents.",

         "['Article: Polio vaccination campaigns in conflicts: succeeding while other humanitarian efforts fail?In conflict settings, public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns and improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could benefit all parties involved. However, while polio vaccination campaigns frequently succeed in securing humanitarian pauses, WASH initiatives attempting to improve safe water supply and sewage disposal rarely achieve the same outcome. Using the Israel-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the success of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify four key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in conflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the subsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, including the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the shortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the straightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their \"neutral\" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the primary beneficiaries. Although polio vaccination campaigns do not typically lead to lasting peace and WASH initiatives often fail to secure even temporary humanitarian pauses, public health efforts should seize every opportunity to foster cooperation between warring parties.']",
         "Polio vaccination campaigns are often successful in securing humanitarian pauses in conflict zones because they are short, vertical programs with a straightforward impact assessment. Their success is also attributed to strong international institutional support and their perceived \"neutral\" character, as they focus narrowly on vaccinating children.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2024 at European Gaza Hospital. Data on demographics and injury types were collected from patients treated by FAJR Scientific's surgical team. Injuries were classified into primary (directly conflict-related), secondary (indirectly conflict-related), and tertiary (unrelated to the conflict). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H test, logistic regression, and Fisher's Exact Test. Among the 80 surgical cases analyzed, primary injuries were the most common (53%), predominantly affecting males aged 30-39. Secondary injuries accounted for 14% of cases, while tertiary injuries represented 33%. Significant associations were found between age categories and injury classifications (p < 0.05). The prevalence of primary injuries highlights the severe impact of conflict on civilians, particularly middle-aged males. The findings suggest the need for enhanced orthopedic surgical capacity, integrated chronic disease management, and specialized pediatric care in conflict zones.\\n\\nInterviewees revealed that their perceptions of their children's health were determined by the camp's conditions, the current economic climate, past and current political conflict and financial and social restrictions.

Both parents reported their exposure to war trauma, secure attachment availability, and parenting practices, as well as the target child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. Children reported their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (on the Children's Revised Impact Event Scale), depression (Birleson), and SDQ, as well as their post-traumatic cognitions (Children's Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory). <b>Results:</b> A cluster analysis identified four family types. The largest type reflected secure attachment and optimal relationships (security and positive family relationships, 36.2%, <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa0102), and the smallest exhibited insecurity and problematic relationships (insecurity and negative family relationships, 15.6%; <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa044). Further, families with discrepant experiences (23.0%; <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa065) and moderate security and neutral relationships (25.2%; <i>n</i>\\xa0=\\xa071) emerged.\",\n",
       " \"<2-hop>\\n\\nArticle: The impact of occupation on child health in a Palestinian refugee camp.This article focuses on child health in the Palestinian refugee camp of Dheisheh in the West Bank region of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Thirty in-depth interviews were carried out with parents to determine their perceptions of their children's health. The questions related to physical, mental and social well-being, access to health facilities, factors that were likely to hinder health and measures that could be implemented to improve child health. The study was carried out prior to and during the Gaza War in December 2008 that resulted in the deaths of 1380 Palestinians including 431 children and 112 women [1]. The effects of occupation, conflict and being a refugee had a detrimental impact on perceptions of health.\",\n",
       " \"<3-hop>\\n\\nMothers reported infants' language, fine- and gross-motor, and socioemotional skills at T2 and researchers tested infants' motor, cognitive-language and socioemotional skills using the Bayley Scales of Infant development (BSID-II) at T3. Mothers reported their mental health problems (symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression and somatization) at T2 and T3 as well as dyadic interaction quality (the emotional availability self-report, [EA-SR] brief) at T2. First, the structural equation model (SEM) on direct effects indicated, in contrast to our hypotheses, that maternal prenatal exposure to traumatic war events did not associate with infants' developmental skills at T2 and predicted higher level of developmental skills at T3. Second, as hypothesized, we found two negative underlying mechanisms (paths) between high exposure and low levels of motor, cognitive-language, and socioemotional skills at T3: (1) through increased maternal mental health problems at T2, which then were associated with problems at T3, and (2) through increased maternal mental health problems at T2, which then were associated with a low quality of mother-infant-interaction and low level of infant developmental skills at T2. Improving maternal mental health and encouraging close and positive dyadic interaction can be critical for infant sensorimotor, cognitive, and socioemotional development in war conditions.\"]"

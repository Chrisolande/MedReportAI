         "In conflict settings, public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns and improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could benefit all parties involved. However, while polio vaccination campaigns frequently succeed in securing humanitarian pauses, WASH initiatives attempting to improve safe water supply and sewage disposal rarely achieve the same outcome. Using the Israel-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the success of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify four key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in conflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the subsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, including the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the shortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the straightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their \"neutral\" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the primary beneficiaries. Although polio vaccination campaigns do not typically lead to lasting peace and WASH initiatives often fail to secure even temporary humanitarian pauses, public health efforts should seize every opportunity to foster cooperation between warring parties. Such initiatives can help build trust, laying the groundwork for future peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction.",

         "To categorize and analyze trauma cases from the Gaza war, identifying injury patterns and informing future humanitarian efforts in conflict zones. A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2024 at European Gaza Hospital. Data on demographics and injury types were collected from patients treated by FAJR Scientific's surgical team. Injuries were classified into primary (directly conflict-related), secondary (indirectly conflict-related), and tertiary (unrelated to the conflict). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H test, logistic regression, and Fisher's Exact Test. Among the 80 surgical cases analyzed, primary injuries were the most common (53%), predominantly affecting males aged 30-39. Secondary injuries accounted for 14% of cases, while tertiary injuries represented 33%. Significant associations were found between age categories and injury classifications (p < 0.05). The prevalence of primary injuries highlights the severe impact of conflict on civilians, particularly middle-aged males. The findings suggest the need for enhanced orthopedic surgical capacity, integrated chronic disease management, and specialized pediatric care in conflict zones. Improved data collection and analysis are essential for optimizing medical interventions and resource allocation.",

         "Adolescents are increasingly consuming energy drinks (EDs), prompting worries about their potential mental health impacts. The association between ED use and psychological effects among Palestinian teenagers, particularly the impact of smoking habits such as waterpipes, electronic cigarettes, and cigarettes, is little studied. This study explores the correlation between ED consumption and mental health outcomes such as depression, insomnia, and stress among adolescents in Palestine. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June 2024, involving adolescents aged 12-18 recruited from schools in the West Bank. Data collection utilized a structured questionnaire assessing ED consumption, smoking habits, depression (PHQ-9), insomnia (ISI), and stress (Adolescent Stress Scale). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29. The research involved 1,668 adolescents, with a mean age of 15.67 years (±1.57 years). ED consumption was prevalent at 74.7 % (95 % CI: 76.5-72.7). Males and smokers, especially those using traditional cigarettes and waterpipes, exhibited a higher likelihood of consuming energy drinks (aPR: 2.18; 95 %CI: 1.64-2.91), (aPR: 2.99; 95 %CI: 1.49-5.59), and (aPR: 2.54; 95 %CI: 1.23-5.19). Depression exhibited a significant relationship with ED consumption (aPR: 2.25; 95%CI: 1.51-3.37). A dose-response relationship was identified between insomnia and ED consumption, with an adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) of 2.42 (95 % CI: 1.56-3.47) for moderate severity and 2.95 (95 % CI: 1.28-6.75) for severe insomnia. ED consumption is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly among smokers. Interventions targeting both ED use and smoking behaviors are crucial to improving mental health in Palestinian adolescents. The study was conducted during the Gaza war, a period marked by heightened stress levels among participants due to increased security checks and economic hardships. These challenges may have influenced participants' stress levels and impacted their purchasing behaviors for EDs and tobacco shisha products. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of these behaviors.",

         "Secondary traumatic stress (STS) has been studied in therapists, spouses, and mainly in children of traumatised individuals. To date, the relationship between children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their parents' mental health outcomes have been understudied, and specifically, long term STS symptoms of parents of war veterans were not investigated. The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war. The control group consisted of veterans from combat military units who were on active duty at the time of the war but did not actively participate in the war (stand-by units) - providing a natural experiment condition. We found that PTSD symptoms were almost twice as high in the directly active war veterans (DAV, <i>N</i> = 32) group compared to the indirectly active war veterans (IAV, <i>N</i> = 26) group. Results showed that mothers had higher STS symptoms in general, and DAV PTSD symptoms correlated with their fathers STS symptoms. The current study provides novel evidence for: (a) subclinical PTSD symptoms in war veterans 5 years after the war, and (b) transmission of trauma from war veterans to their parents. The overall negative effect of sending a child to war on the parents are also discussed.",

         "Polio vaccination campaigns in conflicts: succeeding while other humanitarian efforts fail?In conflict settings, public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns and improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could benefit all parties involved. However, while polio vaccination campaigns frequently succeed in securing humanitarian pauses, WASH initiatives attempting to improve safe water supply and sewage disposal rarely achieve the same outcome. Using the Israel-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the success of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify four key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in conflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the subsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, including the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the shortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the straightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their \"neutral\" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the primary beneficiaries. Although polio vaccination campaigns do not typically lead to lasting peace and WASH initiatives often fail to secure even temporary humanitarian pauses, public health efforts should seize every opportunity to foster cooperation between warring parties. Such initiatives can help build trust, laying the groundwork for future peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction."

A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2024 at European Gaza Hospital. Data on demographics and injury types were collected from patients treated by FAJR Scientific's surgical team. Injuries were classified into primary (directly conflict-related), secondary (indirectly conflict-related), and tertiary (unrelated to the conflict). Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis H test, logistic regression, and Fisher's Exact Test. Among the 80 surgical cases analyzed, primary injuries were the most common (53%), predominantly affecting males aged 30-39. Secondary injuries accounted for 14% of cases, while tertiary injuries represented 33%. Significant associations were found between age categories and injury classifications (p < 0.05). The prevalence of primary injuries highlights the severe impact of conflict on civilians, particularly middle-aged males. The findings suggest the need for enhanced orthopedic surgical capacity, integrated chronic disease management, and specialized pediatric care in conflict zones. Improved data collection and analysis are essential for optimizing medical interventions and resource allocation."

         "Energy drinks, depression, insomnia, and stress in palestinian adolescents: a cross-sectional study.Adolescents are increasingly consuming energy drinks (EDs), prompting worries about their potential mental health impacts. The association between ED use and psychological effects among Palestinian teenagers, particularly the impact of smoking habits such as waterpipes, electronic cigarettes, and cigarettes, is little studied. This study explores the correlation between ED consumption and mental health outcomes such as depression, insomnia, and stress among adolescents in Palestine. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to June 2024, involving adolescents aged 12-18 recruited from schools in the West Bank. Data collection utilized a structured questionnaire assessing ED consumption, smoking habits, depression (PHQ-9), insomnia (ISI), and stress (Adolescent Stress Scale). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 29. The research involved 1,668 adolescents, with a mean age of 15.67 years (±1.57 years). ED consumption was prevalent at 74.7 % (95 % CI: 76.5-72.7). Males and smokers, especially those using traditional cigarettes and waterpipes, exhibited a higher likelihood of consuming energy drinks (aPR: 2.18; 95 %CI: 1.64-2.91), (aPR: 2.99; 95 %CI: 1.49-5.59), and (aPR: 2.54; 95 %CI: 1.23-5.19). Depression exhibited a significant relationship with ED consumption (aPR: 2.25; 95%CI: 1.51-3.37). A dose-response relationship was identified between insomnia and ED consumption, with an adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) of 2.42 (95 % CI: 1.56-3.47) for moderate severity and 2.95 (95 % CI: 1.28-6.75) for severe insomnia. ED consumption is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, particularly among smokers. Interventions targeting both ED use and smoking behaviors are crucial to improving mental health in Palestinian adolescents. The study was conducted during the Gaza war, a period marked by heightened stress levels among participants due to increased security checks and economic hardships. These challenges may have influenced participants' stress levels and impacted their purchasing behaviors for EDs and tobacco shisha products. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of these behaviors."

         "Post-traumatic stress in war veterans and secondary traumatic stress among parents of war veterans five years after the 2014 Israel-Gaza military conflict.Secondary traumatic stress (STS) has been studied in therapists, spouses, and mainly in children of traumatised individuals. To date, the relationship between children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their parents' mental health outcomes have been understudied, and specifically, long term STS symptoms of parents of war veterans were not investigated. The current study examined PTSD symptoms among veterans of the 2014 Israel-Gaza war and STS among their parents, five years after the war. The control group consisted of veterans from combat military units who were on active duty at the time of the war but did not actively participate in the war (stand-by units) - providing a natural experiment condition. We found that PTSD symptoms were almost twice as high in the directly active war veterans (DAV, <i>N</i> = 32) group compared to the indirectly active war veterans (IAV, <i>N</i> = 26) group. Results showed that mothers had higher STS symptoms in general, and DAV PTSD symptoms correlated with their fathers STS symptoms. The current study provides novel evidence for: (a) subclinical PTSD symptoms in war veterans 5 years after the war, and (b) transmission of trauma from war veterans to their parents. The overall negative effect of sending a child to war on the parents are also discussed."

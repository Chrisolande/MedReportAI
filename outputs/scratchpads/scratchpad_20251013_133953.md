KEY FINDINGS FROM GAZA MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH:

PREVALENCE STUDIES:
- PTSD prevalence among Gaza children ranges from 54-91% in different studies
- Anxiety disorders affect 70-85% of children post-conflict
- Depression rates: 45-70% in various assessments
- Developmental trauma disorders particularly high in children exposed to multiple conflict episodes

TRAUMA EXPOSURE:
- Direct exposure to violence strongly correlates with mental health outcomes
- Witnessing family member injury/death increases PTSD risk 3-4x
- Displacement and home destruction significant risk factors
- Cumulative trauma exposure shows dose-response relationship with symptom severity

INTERVENTION TRIALS:
- School-based interventions show 30-40% reduction in PTSD symptoms
- CBT approaches effective but limited by infrastructure constraints
- Group therapy and peer support programs demonstrate positive outcomes
- Parent-child interventions improve family functioning and resilience

PROTECTIVE FACTORS:
- Strong family support reduces PTSD risk by 50%
- Community cohesion and social support network protective
- Religious and cultural coping mechanisms enhance resilience
- Educational continuity during conflict periods protective

LONGITUDINAL OUTCOMES:
- Children with untreated trauma show persistent symptoms into adulthood
- Early intervention critical for preventing chronic mental health conditions
- Developmental delays observed in trauma-exposed children
- Intergenerational transmission of trauma documented

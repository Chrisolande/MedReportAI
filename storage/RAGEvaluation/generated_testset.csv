Both parents reported their exposure to war trauma, secure attachment availability, and parenting practices, as well as the target child's internalizing and externalizing symptoms [Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]. Children reported their symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (on the Children's Revised Impact Event Scale), depression (Birleson), and SDQ, as well as their post-traumatic cognitions (Children's Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory). <b>Results:</b> A cluster analysis identified four family types. The largest type reflected secure attachment and optimal relationships (security and positive family relationships, 36.2%, <i>n</i>\xa0=\xa0102), and the smallest exhibited insecurity and problematic relationships (insecurity and negative family relationships, 15.6%; <i>n</i>\xa0=\xa044).

Using the Israel-Gaza conflict as an example, we analyze the factors contributing to the success of polio vaccination campaigns compared to WASH initiatives. We identify four key elements that facilitate the implementation of polio campaigns in conflict zones: (i) the ubiquitous decline in vaccine coverage and the subsequent detection of polio cases; (ii) international institutional support, including the role of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI); (iii) the shortness of the required humanitarian pauses, the vertical nature, and the straightforward impact assessment of vaccination campaigns; and (iv) their ""neutral"" character due to an intentionally restrictive focus on children as the primary beneficiaries.
